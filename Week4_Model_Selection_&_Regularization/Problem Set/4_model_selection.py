Model selection
===============

We know that (in the “classic” view), the test error of a model tends to decrease and then increase as we increase model complexity. For low complexity, the bias dominates; for high complexity, the variance dominates.

The training error, however, only decreases with increasing model complexity. If we use training error to select a model, we’ll select a model that overfits. And during training, when we select a model, only the training error is available to us.

*Image source: Elements of Statistical Learning*

The solution is cross validation. Until now, we have been dividing our data into two parts:

-   Training data: used to train the model
-   Test data: used to evaluate the performance of our model on new, unseen data

Now, we will make one more split:

-   Training data: used to train the model
-   Validation data: used to select the model complexity (usually by tuning some *hyperparameters*)
-   Test data: used to evaluate the performance of our model on new, unseen data

Furthermore, we will refine this idea in order to reduce the dependence on the particular samples we choose for the training, and to increase the number of samples available for training. In K-fold cross validation, we split the data into $K$ parts, each part being approximately equal in size. For each split, we fit the data on $K-1$ parts and test the data on the remaining part. Then, we average the score over the $K$ parts.

For example, for $K=5$, it might look like this:

"""### Cross validation

Splitting a data set for K-fold cross validation is conceptually very simple. The basic idea is:

-   We get a list of indices of training data, and decide how many “folds” we will use. The number of validation samples in each fold $N_{val}$ wil be the total number of training samples, divided by the number of folds.
-   Then, we iterate over the number of folds. In the first fold, we put the first $N_{val}$ samples in the validation set and exclude them from the training set. In the second fold, we put the second batch of $N_{val}$ samples in the validation set, and exclude them from the training set. Continue until $K$ folds.

In most circumstances, we will shuffle the list of training data indices first.

The `scikit-learn` library provides a `KFold` that does this for us:

"""### Model selection using 1-SE “rule”

When using the minimum K-fold CV error for model selection, we sometimes will still select an overly complex model <sup>\[2\]</sup>.

As an alternative, we can use the “one standard error rule” <sup>\[3\]</sup>. According to this “rule”, we choose the least complex model whose error is no more than one standard error above the error of the best model - i.e. the simplest model whose performance is comparable to the best model.

<small>\[2\] See [Cawley & Talbot (J of Machine Learning Research, 2010)](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/cawley10a/cawley10a.pdf) for more on this.</small>

<small>\[3\] See Chapter 7 of [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) </small>

We apply this rule as follows:

-   Find the MSE for each fold for each model candidate
-   For each model candidate, compute the mean and standard error of the MSE over the $K$ folds. We will compute the standard error as $$\frac{\sigma_{\text{MSE}}}{\sqrt{K-1}}$$ where $\sigma_{\text{MSE}}$ is the standard deviation of the MSE over the $K$ folds.
-   Find the model with the smallest mean MSE (across the $K$ folds). Compute the *target* as mean MSE + SE for this model.
-   Select the least complex model whose mean MSE is below the target.

This works for any metric that is a “lower is better” metric. If you are using a “higher is better” metric, such as R2, for example, you would modify the last two steps:

-   Find the model with the **largest** mean R2 (across the $K$ folds). Compute the **mean R2 - SE of R2** for this model. Call this quantity the *target*.
-   Select the least complex model whose mean R2 is **above** the target.
